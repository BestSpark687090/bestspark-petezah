          In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other

        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
          owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, <strong>PeteZahGames</strong>) are called "first‑party cookies." Cookies set by parties
          other than the website owner are called "third‑party cookies." Third‑party cookies enable third‑party features or functionality to be
          provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          We use first‑ and third‑party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
          operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
          interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising,
          analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
          Cookie Consent Manager. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use
          our Website though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
          controls to accept or refuse cookies.
